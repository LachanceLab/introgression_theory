# Hybrid fitness effects modify fixation probabilities of introgressed alleles

<p><strong>Abstract</strong> Hybridization is a common occurrence in natural populations; as a consequence, introgression is a major source of genetic variation. Despite the evolutionary importance of adaptive introgression, classical population genetics theory does not take into account hybrid fitness effects (HFEs). Specifically, heterosis (i.e., hybrid vigor) and Dobzhansky-Muller incompatibilities (DMIs) influence the fates of introgressed alleles. Here, we adopt a Wright-Fisher model that explicitly incorporates polygenic HFEs that act in <em>trans</em> to an introgressed allele. These HFEs quickly decay over time due to repeated backcrossing, enabling a separation-of-timescales approach. Using mathematical models and computer simulations, we find that HFEs can either hinder or boost the probability of fixation of introgressed alleles, depending on the relative strength of heterosis effects and DMIs. We show that the inclusion of a correction factor (&alpha;, representing the compounded effects of HFEs over time) into Kimuraâ€™s diffusion approximation yields accurate fixation probabilities. Although strong DMI effects may expedite the loss of introgressed alleles, fixation times are largely unchanged by HFEs. We also find that HFEs subtly change the distribution of fitness effects of introgressed alleles that reach fixation.</p>

<p>Below we provide instruction on how to reproduce the figures shown in the text.
To run the following scripts, you will need to have <em>numpy (v=1.20.2)</em>, <em>scipy (v=1.6.3)</em>, <em>matplotlib (v=3.3.4)</em>, <em>mpl-axes-aligner (v=1.1)</em>, <em>seaborn (v=0.11.1)</em>, and <em>multiprocess (v=0.70.12)</em> installed.
They can also be installed from the provided environment.yml file using conda:<br>

<code>conda env create -f environment.yml</code><br>

This will create a new conda environment named *introgression*. Activate the environment by running:<br>

<code>conda activate introgression</code><br>

The parameters used in the publication are set as default, and scripts can be run without specifying them.
They are specified here for illustrative purposes only. Due to stochasticity some figures may slightly differ between runs,</p>

Figures showing the decay of <em>trans</em>-acting HFEs were generated with Lucidshart. The documents can be accessed here: [Figure 1](https://lucid.app/documents/view/c66e34a8-0b55-408a-a391-cdae5a728b08), [Figure S1](https://lucid.app/documents/view/d6916f9b-e44c-484e-91b7-3b701a94cf7d), and [Figure S2](https://lucid.app/documents/view/3d15002b-e5d3-455b-b69a-93539d72d16b)

To reproduce Figure 2 in the paper, run the following code:</br>
<code>python scripts/regimes.py -p 0.0 0.0 0.8 0.0 0.0 -0.8 0.8 -0.8 -s 0.1 -o ./plots/</code>

The heatmap of the fixation probabilities for various values of &eta;<sub>1</sub> and &delta;<sub>sd, 1</sub> (Figure 3) can be reproduced by running:</br>

<code>python scripts/assess_impact_on_fixation_probability.py -s 0.01 -N 10000 -n 100000 -o ./plots/</code>

![Figure 3](plots/difference_emp_theo_fix.jpg)

Figure 4 can be recreated by running the following code:</br>

<code>python scripts/assess_adjusted_fixation_probability.py -N 10000 -s 0.005 0.01 0.02 0.03 0.1 -n 100000 -o ./plots/ --threads 16</code>

![Figure 4](plots/adjusted_pfix.jpg)

The script also produces Figure S9 when the `-e` flag is set.

Figure 5 is generated by executing:<br>

<code>python scripts/analyze_sojourn_times.py -p 0.0 0.0 0.8 0.0 0.0 -0.8 0.8 -0.8 -N 10000 -s 0.01 -n 100000 -o ./plots/</code>

![Figure 5](plots/sojourn_times.jpg)

The effect on the DFE conditioned on fixation (Figure 6) can be visualized by running:</br>

<code>python scripts/distribution_of_fitness_effects.py -N 10000 --mean_exp 0.0085 --mean_normal -0.001 --std_normal 0.05 -o -n1 10000000 -n2 100000./plots/</code>

![Figure 6](plots/dfe_normal_simulations.jpg)

The script also generates Figures S12 & S13 by setting the `-j` and `-b` flags.

All other Supplementary Figures can be generated with the same commands but setting the <code>--recessive</code> or <code>--dominant</code>  flag in addition.

Alternatively, all figures can be reproduced by running <code>./reproduce_all.sh <threads=16></code>
